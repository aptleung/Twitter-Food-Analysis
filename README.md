# Analyizing Tweets for Food-borne Illnesses

A project where Tweets were taken and filtered down to food related tweets in North America then analyzed to identify trends in food and food-borne illnesses.
Supervised (NB, SVM, etc..) and unsupervised (LDA, BTM) learning approaches were performed using Python and R. All natural language processing was performed using NLTK.
